Visualization of the Collatz Conjecture using Processing

The <b>Collatz conjecture</b> is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns sequences defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
